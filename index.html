        <p style="text-align: justify;">The summer of 2018 was extra special for me. Getting selected to GSoC for the first time and the organization being <a href="https://fossasia.org/" target="_blank">FOSSASIA</a> made the opportunity much more valuable. During the period I was working on an open source hardware platform which enables school children, teachers, undergraduates and even electronic hobbyists to overcome the issue of having costly electronic measurement and debugging tools in their scientific experiments and projects.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Pocket Science Lab by FOSSASIA integrates commonly used electronic equipments such as Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, Logic Analyzer in a lab and even a connectivity to common I<sup>2</sup>C sensors into a pocket sized device using a PIC micro-controller. The functionalities can be accessed using a dektop application or an Android application.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">The project consisted of three repositories which I had to work on. <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android" target="_blank">PSLab Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-hardware" target="_blank">PSLab Hardware</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-firmware" target="_blank">PSLab Firmware</a>. The major outcome of the project was to develop an Android application with the similar functionalities as the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-desktop-apps" target="_blank">PSLab Desktop</a> application and improve the existing PSLab hardware and firmware. During the first month, I was giving priority to enhance the PSLab firmware using MPLab IDE used to program PIC micro-controllers and adding features to the PSLab hardware schematics using KiCAD; an open source ECAD software tool. In the latter two months, I was working on developing the Android application with fellow developers. At the end of GSoC we were able to deliver a functional Android application.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I got an amazing chance to work with a great development team during the summer; Akarshan, Asitava, Jithin and Vivek. The mentors from FOSSASIA were really interactive and responsive. It was the combined effort which made GSoC '18 a great unforgettable summer with lots of experience!</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">I introduced myself to the community and got to know fellow developers. Some of the software tools such as KiCAD was new to me. I spent my time to install them and got to know how to work with these tools and brushed up my knowledge on the supportive programming languages and tools.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile in the Android application, I developed the grid view for Applications layout and fixed the orientation issues it had. Optimizations were done to improve application performance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Work related to firmware and hardware also started. As the initial step I've began to modularize the existing firmware to application specific modules.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Continued with creating seperate modules in the PSLab firmware. In the hardware schematics, implemented an enhanced oscillator and finalized the voltage regulator. The space on the pcb layout was optimized so that new components can be placed easily. In the Android repository, began working on porting functionalities in the python repository and tested slider bars to be implemented in the relevant UIs.</p>
